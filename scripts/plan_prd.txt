# Technical Architecture  

**System Components**  
- Frontend: Next.js with TailwindCSS.  
- Backend: Node.js (Express or Fastify).  
- Database: PostgreSQL (primary storage), Redis (caching).  
- Background Jobs: BullMQ for task scheduling (reminders, retries).  
- Storage: AWS S3 (optional, for media like invite images).

**Data Models**  
- User: id, name, contact info, preferences.  
- Event: id, userId, type (date/party), details, budget, status.  
- Vendor: id, apiId, name, type, location, costRange.  
- Task: id, eventId, description, dueDate, status.  
- RSVP: id, eventId, guestName, email/phone, responseStatus.

**APIs and Integrations**  
- Yelp Fusion API: Activity and restaurant discovery.  
- Google Places API: Location-based service search.  
- Eventbrite API: Ticketed event discovery.  
- OpenTable API: Restaurant reservation booking.  
- Etsy API: Decorations and supplies.  
- SendGrid API: Email invitations and confirmations.  
- Twilio API: SMS invitations and notifications.  
- Stripe API: Payment processing.  
- Google Calendar API: Calendar event integration.

**Infrastructure Requirements**  
- Hosting: AWS EC2/Lambda or Vercel for frontend, AWS backend services.  
- Security: HTTPS everywhere, JWT authentication, OAuth login.  
- Monitoring: Sentry or Datadog for application monitoring.

# Development Roadmap  

**MVP Requirements**  
- User registration and login system.  
- Basic "Plan a Date" wizard flow with static activity recommendations.  
- Basic "Plan a Party" wizard flow with static themes and invite templates.  
- Yelp API integration for venue and activity discovery.  
- Basic RSVP tracking with email invitations (SendGrid integration).  
- Event dashboard to manage booked activities and guest lists.

**Future Enhancements**  
- OpenTable and Eventbrite integrations for real-time bookings.  
- Stripe payment system for reservations and ticket purchases.  
- Twilio SMS support for invitations and reminders.  
- First-date survey generation and response handling.  
- Full vendor order automation for supplies (Etsy/Amazon APIs).  
- Budget tracker per event with dynamic cost updates.  
- Calendar synchronization for planned events.  
- Mobile app/PWA for improved mobile user experience.

# Logical Dependency Chain  

- User authentication and profile setup must be built first.  
- Core wizards (date planner and party planner) should be built next to allow early user flow testing.  
- Vendor search integrations (Yelp) should follow to populate suggestions.  
- Event creation and management (task lists, dashboard) needs to be implemented after basic flows are stable.  
- Communication system (email invites) should come next to support RSVP tracking.  
- Booking/payment integration, first-date surveys, and real-time vendor management should be layered in later phases.  
- Calendar sync, supply ordering, and mobile enhancements should be reserved for post-MVP expansion.

# Risks and Mitigations  

- Technical Challenges: Integration limits or instability from third-party APIs (e.g., Yelp daily limits).  
  - Mitigation: Cache results, queue search requests, fallback APIs.  
- MVP Scope Creep: Risk of trying to integrate too many APIs initially.  
  - Mitigation: Lock MVP to Yelp search + static party templates only.  
- Payment and Security Compliance: Handling sensitive user data and transactions.  
  - Mitigation: Use Stripe Elements, store no raw payment data, enforce HTTPS, monitor for vulnerabilities.  
- Vendor Availability Gaps: Vendors may not always have complete information.  
  - Mitigation: Allow manual overrides for user-selected vendors when automatic booking fails.

# Appendix  

- Research Findings: Users prefer curated experiences to large lists of choices when under time pressure. Date and party planning are most successful when suggestion lists are under 10 options.  
- Technical Specifications:  
  - API call rate limit handling and retries.  
  - GDPR compliance for user data.  
  - Serverless fallback options if scaling beyond MVP needs.
